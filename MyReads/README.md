Welcome to Mason's MyReads Project!

This project lets you keep your books organized and search for new ones. You can place the books on 3 virtual shelves; Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read.

I used Node.js to install, launch and run the project.

First, navigate your console to the project directory

Then install the project dependencies:
    npm install

Finally, start the http server
    npm start

Node will then launch the app in your default browser.

Happy Reading!
