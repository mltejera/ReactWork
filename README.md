# React Work

<b>Contacts</b>
In this project, I learned about some of the underpinning functionality that makes React tick. I created and nested components, passed props, manipulated state and navigated with the router. I created a simple app that lets the user view, add and remove contacts from a list. Note that css was imported.

<b>My Reads</b>
Here we hammered home the fundementals of React. In this app, the user can manage their library of books, moving them between shelves and searching for new ones through an API. The challenge of this app was reflecting the proper state of all the books; making sure their virtual shelf was consistent on all pages. Note that css was imported.

<b>Goals and Todos</b>
A basic app used to learn how Redux can manage state. I explored how actions and reducers interact with the store by creating a basic single page app to manage goals and todo items.

<b>Chirper</b>
A basic twitter clone for more practice managing state with Redux, navigating with the router and breaking up UI into components. Used a mock data service for data management.
