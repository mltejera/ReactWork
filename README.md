# ReactWork

<h1>Contacts</h1>

In this project, I learned about some of the underpinning functionality that makes React tick. I created and nested components, passed props, manipulated state and navigated with the router. I created a simple app that lets the user view, add and remove contacts from a list. Note that basic css was imported.
